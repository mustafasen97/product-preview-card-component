## Overview

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process
- Go over figma design and design system for the project
- Read Development requirement
- Mobile first webflow

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned how to use the <picture> element and apply media query to image attribute to display a specific image based on the screen size.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
      <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Perfume bottle">
    </picture>
```


### Continued development
I plan on solving more front end challenges in order to meet
different cases and code experiences.
